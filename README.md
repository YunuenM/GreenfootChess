# GreenfootChess

## Description
This is a recreation of the beloved game of Chess in Greenfoot. It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 
At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, 
two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate 
attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape.
